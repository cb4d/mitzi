# Mitzi: An automated web/dash-cam for priscilla.

- Turn Mitzi on and she'll take photos periodically which are uploaded to the cloud
- Photos can be viewed via a password-protected public link

Ideally with geotagging - maybe next iteration.

## Implementation:

### Front end

A rpi zero 2 w and camera module. Some kind of casing that allow for mounting in the cabin,
and maybe for powering via battery?

Should be able to turn it on and it just starts working.
Ideally with the most minimal config possible - just a wifi password?

The rest of config could come via something like s3.

Something like systemd services to:
- reads a remote config or falls back to local default config
- take a picture every interval and store indexed by timestamp - will require accurate time
- upload unuploaded pics to s3
- prune local storage on a regular interval

###Â Back end

Should be as cheap and easy to run as possble.

is this afforadble?
Photos stored in S3 with some kind of automated archiving to keep storage costs low
retention will probably depend on cost, but could be something like every 10 mins for last hr, every hr for last day, every 3h for last week.
ideally older stuff would get archived v v cheaply

Static gallery site to view all photos, in date descending order, as a carousel, maybe with a date search??
