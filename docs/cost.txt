How much is aws going to cost for this project?

a 100% jpeg for a 12MP camera is approx 3.6MB. let's call that 4...

a pic every 10 mins for an hour = 6 pics, 24MB
every 10 mins for 12 hrs = 72 pics, 288MB
28 days of 12 hrs of 6 pics per hr = 2016 pics, 8064MB


s3 standard : storage 0.023 /GB/month, think data out is gonna be free for cloudfront, 0.09 /GB/month for a download

so like a dollar a month to store? will need to keep an eye on cost i guess
